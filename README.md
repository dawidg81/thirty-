# ccraft

**ccraft** is a custom Minecraft Classic server.

## Inspirations
- **Thirty** by Sean Baggaley ([Firestick Games on GitLab](http://dev.firestick.games/sean/thirty))
- **terse.py** by jshtab ([Gist](https://gist.github.com/jshtab/0d112f45b7e4a9aeda619c3368ea72d6))
- **fCraft** by mstefarov ([Github](https://github.com/mstefarov/fCraft))

## Concept
ccraft will be written in C++ and is going to be an alternative to MCGalaxy server software. It is going to support Minecraft's Classic Server Protocol and maybe even extensions (WoM/ClassiCube) of it.

Documentation for the protocol this server uses can be found here:

- [Minecraft Classic Server Protocol (Minecraft Wiki Fandom)](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Classic_server_protocol)
- [Classic Protocol (archived from wiki.vg)](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg_merge/Classic_Protocol)
- [Classic Server Protocol (Minecraft Wiki)](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Classic_server_protocol)
