# Thirty+
Thirty+ is a clone of the original Thirty by Sean Baggaley (Minecraft Classic/Classicube server software): https://dev.firestick.games/sean/thirty

The source code has been **not** directly forked from the original repository, it is going to be rewritten from scratch, along with having custom tweaks and changes from the original project. This is reason why Thirty+ is being called a **clone**, not a fork.
